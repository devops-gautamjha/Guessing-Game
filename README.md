# Guessing-Game
A Simple number guessing game build with Go. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the game provides feedback ("Too High" or "To Low") until the correct number is guessed. A fun way to practice conditionals, loops, user input, and random number generation in Go.
